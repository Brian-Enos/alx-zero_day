# **Version Control**

## **Introduction**
* >Version control is a system that allows you to track changes to a file or a set of files over time. It enables you to keep a history of every version of a file, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work.


Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in source code during software development. It provides features like branching and merging, enabling multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously while keeping track of all changes made.

This repository contains the tasks given during the course of my software engineering journey at ALX covering Git .

# **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, I was expected to be able to [explain to anyone](), without the help of Google amd to understand:

* What is source code management
* What is Git
* What is GitHub
* What is the difference between Git and GitHub
* How to create a repository
* What is a README
* How to write good READMEs
* How to commit
* How to write helpful commit messages
* How to push code
* How to pull updates
* How to create a branch
* How to merge branches
* How to work as collaborators on a project
* Which files should and which files should not appear in your repo


## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about System Engineering DevOps or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.
